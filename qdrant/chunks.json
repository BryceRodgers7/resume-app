Use this to identify missing information and avoid incomplete order submissions.\n\nSTEP 1: When to Use\n- Customer expresses intent to place an order\n- Customer mentions wanting to buy products\n- Before EVERY create_order call\n\nSTEP 2: Gather Information Progressively\n- Call draft_order with whatever information you have so far\n- Pass all known fields, use null/empty for unknown fields\n- Review the response for missing_fields array\n\nSTEP 3: Request Missing Information\n- Ask for missing items naturally in conversation\n- Do NOT use forms or structured lists\n- Example: 'I'll need your shipping address to complete this order. Where should we send it?'\n\nSTEP 4: Iterate Until Complete\n- Call draft_order again after collecting more information\n- Continue until ready_to_order = true\n\nSTEP 5: Validate Product Information\n- draft_order checks product availability and inventory\n- draft_order calculates total cost and weight\n- Review the order_summary provided\n\nSTEP 6: Only Then Create Order\n- When ready_to_order = true, call create_order with complete information\n- Use exact same parameters validated by draft_order\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- NEVER call create_order without successful draft_order first\n- NEVER proceed if draft_order shows inventory issues\n- ALWAYS pass product_ids and quantities as arrays of same length\n- Product IDs must be integers from the catalog"},
